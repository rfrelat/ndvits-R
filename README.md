**Please keep it mind that this package, originally hosted in R-Forge, has not been updated since 2011 and was developed on R 2.10. This is an archive, the package does not run on current version of R. For analysis of NDVI, please have a look at [MODISTools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODISTools/vignettes/modistools-vignette.html)**



The routines extract automatically, for area of interest, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from different optical satellite instruments  (AVHRR, Spot Vegetation) and to provide tools to display and analyze the time series.Functions have been developed to study landscapes and more especially to detect changes in land use land cover. Phenological metrics can be computed for every season as well as vegetation anomaly maps.
